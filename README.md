# AdventOfCode2020
This repo contains my work on the 2020 Advent Of Code.  This year I decided to write a console application that I will gradually build onto each day.  When running the console app, one just passes in the day number and the app will solve that days challenges.  In the spirit of good dev practaces I am TDDing each days solution so there is a corresponding test class for each day.
